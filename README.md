A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
innovative app for children's health and vaccines, designed to help parents keep track of their child's health and well-being. The app includes a vaccine reminder system, which sends alerts to parents when their child is due for a vaccination. It also features an autism detection tool, which can help parents identify early signs of autism in their child.

In addition, the app provides helpful tips and information on developmental milestones, allowing parents to track their child's progress and ensure they are meeting important milestones. We also incorporated a BMI calculator, which can help parents monitor their child's weight and ensure they are growing at a healthy rate.

The app includes comprehensive information about different vaccines and their importance in a child's life, ensuring parents are well-informed and able to make informed decisions about their child's healthcare. We also included a chatbot feature, which allows parents to ask any questions they may have about vaccines, providing them with reliable and accurate information.

Overall, our app is an all-in-one solution for parents looking to keep their child healthy and up-to-date with vaccinations. We are proud to have developed such a valuable tool for parents and are confident it will make a positive impact on children's health and well-being.
